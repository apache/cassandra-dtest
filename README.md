Cassandra Distributed Tests (DTests)
====================================

Cassandra Distributed Tests (or better known as "DTests") are a set of Python-based 
tests for [Apache Cassandra](http://apache.cassandra.org) clusters. DTests aim to 
test functionality that requires multiple Cassandra instances. Functionality that
of code that can be tested in isolation should ideally be a unit test (which can be
found in the actual Cassandra repository). 

Setup and Prerequisites
------------

Some environmental setup is required before you can start running DTests.

### Native Dependencies
DTests requires the following native dependencies:
 * Python 3
 * PIP for Python 3 
 * libev
 * git
 * JDK 8 (Java)
 
#### Linux
1. ``apt-get install git-core python3 python3-pip python3-dev libev4 libev-dev``
2. (Optional - solves warning: "jemalloc shared library could not be preloaded to speed up memory allocations"): 
``apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libjemalloc1``

#### Mac
On Mac, the easiest path is to install the latest [Xcode and Command Line Utilities](https://developer.apple.com) to 
bootstrap your development environment and then use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

1. (Optional) Make sure brew is in a good state on your system ``brew doctor``
2. ``brew install python3 libev``

### Python Dependencies
There are multiple external Python dependencies required to run DTests. 
The current Python dependency list is maintained in a file named
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/requirements.txt) 
in the root of the `cassandra-dtest` repository.

The easiest way to install these dependencies is with pip and virtualenv. 

**Note**: While virtualenv isn't strictly required, using virtualenv is almost always the quickest 
path to success as it provides common base setup across various configurations.

1. Install virtualenv: ``pip install virtualenv``
2. Create a new virtualenv: ``virtualenv --python=python3 --no-site-packages ~/dtest``
3. Switch/Activate the new virtualenv: ``source ~/dtest/bin/activate``
4. Install remaining DTest Python dependencies: ``pip install -r /path/to/cassandra-dtest/requirements.txt``


Usage
-----

The tests are executed by the pytest framework. For convenience, a wrapper ``run_dtests.py`` 
is included with the intent to make starting execution of the dtests with sane defaults as easy 
as possible. Most users will most likely find that invoking the tests directly using ``pytest`` 
ultimately works the best and provides the most flexibility.

Pytest has a great [Usage and Invocations](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html) document which is a great place to start for basic invocation options when using pytest.

At minimum, 

  The only thing the framework needs to know is
the location of the (compiled (hint: ``ant clean jar``)) sources for Cassandra. There are two options:

Use existing sources:

    pytest --cassandra-dir=~/path/to/cassandra

Use ccm ability to download/compile released sources from archives.apache.org:

    pytest --cassandra-version=1.0.0

A convenient option if tests are regularly run against the same existing
directory is to set `cassandra_dir` in `~/path/to/cassandra-dtest/pytest.ini`:

    [pytest]
    cassandra_dir=~/path/to/cassandra

The tests will use this directory by default, avoiding the need for any
environment variable (that still will have precedence if given though).

Existing tests are probably the best place to start to look at how to write
tests.

The ``run_dtests.py`` included script is simply a wrapper to make starting the dtests 
with sane defaults as simple as possible. If you just want to run the tests and do nothing more, 
this is most likely the most easy place to start; however, anyone attempting to do active development
 and testing will find invoking pytest directly to be likely the best option.

Each test spawns a new fresh cluster and tears it down after the test. If a
test fails, the logs for the node are saved in a `logs/<timestamp>` directory
for analysis (it's not perfect but has been good enough so far, I'm open to
better suggestions).

To run the upgrade tests, you have must both JDK7 and JDK8 installed. Paths
to these installations should be defined in the environment variables
JAVA7_HOME and JAVA8_HOME, respectively.

Writing Tests
-------------

- If you're using JMX via [the `tools.jmxutils` module](tools/jmxutils.py), make sure to call `remove_perf_disable_shared_mem` on the node or nodes you want to query with JMX _before starting the nodes_. `remove_perf_disable_shared_mem` disables a JVM option that's incompatible with JMX (see [this JMX ticket](https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues/198)). It works by performing a string replacement in the node's Cassandra startup script, so changes will only propagate to the node at startup time.

If you'd like to know what to expect during a code review, please see the included [CONTRIBUTING file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Debugging Tests
-------------
Some general tips for debugging dtest/pytest tests

#### pytest.set_trace()
If there is an unexpected value being asserted on and you'd like to inspect the state of all the tests variables just before a paricular assert, add ``pytest.set_trace()`` right before the problematic code. The next time you execute the test, when that line of code is reached pytest will drop you into an interactive python debugger (pdb). From there you can use standard python options to inspect various methods and variables for debugging.

#### Hung tests/hung pytest framework
Debugging hung tests can be very difficult but thanks to improvements in Python 3 it's now pretty painless to get a python thread dump of all the threads currently running in the pytest process.

```python
import faulthandler
faulthandler.enable()
```
Adding the above code will install a signal handler into your process. When the process recieves a *SIGABRT* signal, python will dump python thread dumps for all running threads in the process. DTests installs this by default with the install_debugging_signal_handler fixture.

The following is an example of what you might see if you send a *SIGABRT* signal to the pytest process while in a hung state during the test teardown phase after the successful completion of the actual dtest.

```bash
(env) cassandra-dtest vcooluser$ kill -SIGABRT 24142

#### Debugging Issues with Fixtures and Test Setup/Teardown
pytest can appear to be doing "magic" more often than not. One place it may be hard to follow what actual code will get executed by normal code inspection alone is determining which fixtures will run for a given test and in what order. pytest provides a ``--setup-plan`` command line argument. When pytest is invoked with this argument it will print a execution plan including all fixtures and tests that actually running the test will invoke. The below is an example for the current execution plan pytest generates for dtest *auth_test.py::TestAuthRoles::test_create_drop_role*

```bash
(env3) Michaels-MacBook-Pro:cassandra-dtest mkjellman$ pytest --cassandra-dir=/Users/mkjellman/src/mkjellman-oss-github-cassandra-trunk auth_test.py::TestAuthRoles::test_create_drop_role --setup-plan

#### Instances Failing to Start (Unclean Test Teardown)
Getting into a state (especially while writing new tests or debugging problamatic ones) where pytest/dtest fails to fully tear-down all local C* instancse that were started. You can use this handy one liner to kill all C* instances in one go:

```bash
ps aux | grep -ie CassandraDaemon | grep java | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```
