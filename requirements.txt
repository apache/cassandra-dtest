# For ccm changes, please, create a PR to the master branch of the ccm repository.
# New commits to master are not automatically used by the python dtests. And changes 
# made to ccm and intended/needed to be used by the dtests can be put in use by re-tagging cassandra-test to master's HEAD.
# The re-tagging approach is
# git tag -a -f cassandra-test
# git push origin :refs/tags/cassandra-test
# git push -f origin refs/tags/cassandra-test
#
# In case you want to test a patch with your own CCM branch, further to changing below CCM repo and branch name, you need to add -e flag at the beginning
# Example: -e git+https://github.com/userb/ccm.git@cassandra-17182#egg=ccm
git+https://github.com/riptano/ccm.git@cassandra-test#egg=ccm
