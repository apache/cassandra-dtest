# For ccm changes, please, create a PR to the master branch of the ccm repository.
# New commits to master are not automatically used by the python dtests. And changes 
# made to ccm and intended/needed to be used by the dtests can be put in use by re-tagging cassandra-test to master's HEAD.
# The re-tagging approach is
# git tag -a -f cassandra-test
# git push origin :refs/tags/cassandra-test
# git push -f origin refs/tags/cassandra-test
